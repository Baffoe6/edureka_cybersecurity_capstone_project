# GitHub Actions Configuration

## Workflow Files Created

### 1. Security Testing Pipeline
**File:** `.github/workflows/security-testing.yml`
- Validates security tools installation
- Checks script syntax and permissions
- Validates wordlists and documentation
- Generates security reports

### 2. Code Quality Pipeline  
**File:** `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
- Performs markdown and shell script linting
- Validates project structure
- Checks dependencies and documentation
- Generates quality reports

### 3. Automated Security Assessment
**File:** `.github/workflows/automated-assessment.yml`
- Runs scheduled security assessments
- Supports manual dispatch with parameters
- Generates assessment reports
- Provides PR security status

### 4. Release Pipeline
**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Creates release packages
- Generates release notes
- Validates release requirements
- Creates GitHub releases

## Pipeline Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/develop branches** - Runs security and quality checks
- **Pull requests** - Validates changes and provides security status
- **Daily schedule** - Runs security testing (2 AM UTC)
- **Weekly schedule** - Runs automated assessment (Sunday 3 AM UTC)
- **Tag pushes** - Triggers release pipeline

### Manual Triggers
- **Automated Assessment** - Configurable target and assessment type
- **Release Pipeline** - Manual release creation with version control

## Security Considerations

### CI/CD Security
- All assessments run in safe mode
- No actual penetration testing in automated pipelines
- Target validation required for manual assessments
- Secure artifact storage and access

### Best Practices
- Regular pipeline updates and maintenance
- Security tool version management
- Documentation synchronization
- Access control for sensitive operations

## Usage Instructions

### Running Manual Assessments
1. Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Automated Security Assessment"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure target IP and assessment type
5. Review generated reports in artifacts

### Creating Releases
1. Create and push a version tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
2. Release pipeline automatically triggers
3. Download release package from GitHub releases
4. Review release notes and artifacts

### Monitoring Pipeline Health
- Check Actions tab for pipeline status
- Review artifacts for detailed reports
- Monitor security assessment results
- Track code quality metrics over time

## Pipeline Benefits

### For Development
- ✅ Automated validation on every commit
- ✅ Consistent code quality standards
- ✅ Security tool validation
- ✅ Documentation maintenance

### For Security
- ✅ Regular security assessments
- ✅ Automated vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Security documentation validation
- ✅ Safe mode testing

### For Operations
- ✅ Automated release management
- ✅ Package generation and distribution
- ✅ Artifact storage and retrieval
- ✅ Deployment automation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Script permissions** - Ensure scripts are executable
2. **Tool installation** - Verify tool availability in CI environment
3. **File paths** - Check relative paths in scripts
4. **Dependencies** - Ensure all required tools are installed

### Debugging Steps
1. Check Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Review artifact outputs
3. Validate script syntax locally
4. Test tool installations manually
5. Check GitHub Actions runner environment
