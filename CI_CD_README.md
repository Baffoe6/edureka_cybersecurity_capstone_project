# CI/CD Configuration for Cybersecurity Capstone Project

## Overview
This project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate security testing, code quality checks, and release management.

## Workflows

### 1. Security Testing Pipeline (`.github/workflows/security-testing.yml`)
- **Triggers:** Push to main/develop, Pull requests, Daily schedule
- **Purpose:** Validates security tools, script syntax, and project structure
- **Features:**
  - Automated security tool installation
  - Script syntax validation
  - Wordlist validation
  - Security documentation checks
  - Report generation

### 2. Code Quality Pipeline (`.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`)
- **Triggers:** Push to main/develop, Pull requests
- **Purpose:** Ensures code quality and documentation standards
- **Features:**
  - Markdown linting
  - Shell script linting with ShellCheck
  - Project structure validation
  - Dependency analysis
  - Documentation quality checks

### 3. Automated Security Assessment (`.github/workflows/automated-assessment.yml`)
- **Triggers:** Weekly schedule, Manual dispatch
- **Purpose:** Runs automated security assessments
- **Features:**
  - Configurable target assessment
  - Safe mode testing
  - Report generation
  - PR comments for security status

### 4. Release Pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Triggers:** Tag pushes, Manual dispatch
- **Purpose:** Creates releases and deployment packages
- **Features:**
  - Release validation
  - Package creation
  - Release notes generation
  - GitHub release creation

## CI/CD Benefits

### Security
- ✅ Automated security tool validation
- ✅ Regular vulnerability assessments
- ✅ Security documentation checks
- ✅ Safe mode testing for CI/CD

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ Code syntax validation
- ✅ Documentation quality checks
- ✅ Project structure validation
- ✅ Dependency verification

### Automation
- ✅ Automated testing on every commit
- ✅ Scheduled security assessments
- ✅ Automated release management
- ✅ Artifact generation and storage

### DevOps Best Practices
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code
- ✅ Continuous Integration
- ✅ Automated Deployment
- ✅ Security in CI/CD pipeline

## Usage

### Running Manual Assessments
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Automated Security Assessment"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure target IP and assessment type
5. Review generated reports

### Creating Releases
1. Create a tag: `git tag v1.0.0`
2. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
3. Release pipeline will automatically run
4. Download release package from GitHub

### Monitoring Pipeline Status
- Check Actions tab for pipeline status
- Review artifacts for detailed reports
- Monitor security assessment results
- Track code quality metrics

## Security Considerations

### CI/CD Security
- All assessments run in safe mode
- No actual penetration testing in CI/CD
- Target validation required for manual runs
- Secure artifact storage

### Best Practices
- Regular pipeline updates
- Security tool updates
- Documentation maintenance
- Access control for sensitive operations

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Script permissions:** Ensure scripts are executable
2. **Tool installation:** Check tool availability in CI environment
3. **File paths:** Verify relative paths in scripts
4. **Dependencies:** Ensure all required tools are installed

### Pipeline Debugging
1. Check Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Review artifact outputs
3. Validate script syntax locally
4. Test tool installations manually
