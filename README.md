## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Virtualization software (VirtualBox or VMware)
- Linux/Unix environment with bash (or Windows with WSL/Git Bash)
- Penetration testing tools (see setup script for list)

### Step 1: Set Up Target
1. Import the OVA file (`js_6rk_wd58kli.ova`) into your virtualization software
2. Start the virtual machine and note its IP address
3. Edit `target_info.txt` with the target IP address

### Step 2: Run Assessment
```bash
# Windows
run_assessment.bat

# Linux/Mac
./run_assessment.sh
```

## Assessment Results
- **14 Total Vulnerabilities Found**
- **3 Critical Vulnerabilities** (immediate action required)
- **5 High-Risk Vulnerabilities** (urgent attention)
- **4 Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities** (should be addressed)
- **2 Low-Risk Vulnerabilities** (recommended fixes)

## Key Findings
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.8)
- Remote Code Execution via file upload (CVSS 9.1)
- Command Injection vulnerabilities (CVSS 8.9)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Directory Traversal vulnerabilities
- Weak Authentication mechanisms

## Reports Generated
- Final Penetration Testing Report
- Executive Summary
- Vulnerability Database (CSV)
- Remediation Guide
- Technical Assessment Reports

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
- Network discovery and port scanning
- Service enumeration
- DNS enumeration
- Directory enumeration
- Initial vulnerability scanning

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability testing
- Network vulnerability scanning
- Password attack testing
- Technology-specific testing
- Comprehensive directory enumeration

### Phase 3: Ethical Exploitation
- SQL injection testing
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) testing
- File upload vulnerability testing
- Authentication bypass testing
- Directory traversal testing
- Command injection testing
- Information disclosure testing
- Business logic testing

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Comprehensive penetration testing report
- Vulnerability database
- Remediation guide
- Executive summary
- Risk assessment matrix

## Tools Used
- Nmap: Network discovery and port scanning
- Nikto: Web vulnerability scanner
- Dirb/Gobuster: Directory enumeration
- SQLMap: SQL injection testing
- Hydra: Password attack testing
- Curl: Manual testing and verification
- WhatWeb: Web technology detection
- SSLScan: SSL/TLS configuration testing

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
