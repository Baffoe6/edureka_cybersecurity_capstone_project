Security Remediation Guide
==========================

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for remediating the vulnerabilities
identified during the penetration test of ecommerce-test.local.

1. SQL Injection Remediation
   - Replace dynamic SQL queries with parameterized queries
   - Implement input validation and sanitization
   - Use prepared statements for all database operations
   - Example: Use PDO or mysqli prepared statements in PHP

2. Command Injection Remediation
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Use whitelist validation for allowed commands
   - Escape special characters in user input
   - Consider using safer alternatives to system commands

3. Cross-Site Scripting Remediation
   - Implement output encoding for all user-controlled data
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
   - Validate and sanitize all user input
   - Use context-appropriate encoding (HTML, URL, JavaScript)

4. Directory Traversal Remediation
   - Implement proper file access controls
   - Validate file paths and restrict access to allowed directories
   - Use chroot or similar mechanisms to restrict file system access
   - Implement proper error handling

5. File Upload Security
   - Implement file type validation
   - Restrict file uploads to specific directories
   - Scan uploaded files for malware
   - Implement file size limits

6. Authentication Security
   - Implement strong password policies
   - Add multi-factor authentication
   - Implement account lockout mechanisms
   - Use secure session management

7. Security Headers Implementation
   - X-Frame-Options: Prevent clickjacking
   - X-Content-Type-Options: Prevent MIME sniffing
   - X-XSS-Protection: Enable XSS filtering
   - Strict-Transport-Security: Enforce HTTPS
   - Content-Security-Policy: Prevent XSS and data injection

8. General Security Recommendations
   - Regular security assessments
   - Security training for development teams
   - Implement security monitoring and logging
   - Keep all software and dependencies updated
   - Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

Priority Timeline:
- Critical vulnerabilities: Fix within 24 hours
- High-risk vulnerabilities: Fix within 1 week
- Medium-risk vulnerabilities: Fix within 1 month
- Low-risk vulnerabilities: Fix within 3 months
