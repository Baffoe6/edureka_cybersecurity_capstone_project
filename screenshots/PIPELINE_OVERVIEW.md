## 🔐 Security Gates

### Environment Variables
```yaml
SECURITY_SCAN_TIMEOUT: 1800
VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD: 5
CRITICAL_THRESHOLD: 1
```

### Gate Logic
```bash
if [ $CRITICAL_COUNT -gt $CRITICAL_THRESHOLD ]; then
  echo "❌ SECURITY GATE FAILED"
  exit 1
elif [ $HIGH_COUNT -gt $VULNERABILITY_THRESHOLD ]; then
  echo "⚠️ SECURITY GATE WARNING"
else
  echo "✅ SECURITY GATE PASSED"
fi
```
